<h4>Debuggex, Inc. â€“ Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>Last Updated: November 21, 2018</p>

<p>
  This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are
  concerned with how their &apos;Personally Identifiable Information&apos;
  (PII) is being used online.

</p>

<p>
  All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored
  or processed on our servers.
</p>

<h4>Do we use &apos;cookies&apos;?</h4>

<p>
  Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers
  to your computer&apos;s hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow)
  that enables the site&apos;s or service provider&apos;s systems to recognize
  your browser and capture and remember certain information.
  For instance, we use cookies to help us remember which account you&apos;re
  logged into.
  They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or
  current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services.
  We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and
  site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in
  the future.
</p>

<h4>We use cookies to:</h4>

<ul>

    We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information
    on our behalf.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent,
  or you can choose to turn off all cookies.
  You do this through your browser settings.
  Since browser is a little different, look at your browser&apos;s Help Menu
  to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.
</p>

<h4>If users disable cookies in their browser:</h4>

</p>

<h4>Third-party disclosure</h4>

<p>
  We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your

  This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist
  us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users,
  so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.
  We may also release information when it&apos;s release is appropriate to
  comply with the law, enforce our site policies,
  or protect ours or others&apos; rights, property or safety.

  Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include links to other sites on

  data about site traffic and site interactions.
